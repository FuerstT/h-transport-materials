Tritium residence time in the experimental system decreased with increasing H2 pressure in He sweep gas up to 1000 Pa, and above this limiting concentration it became constant. This result suggests that the tritium release rate was controlled only by the tritium diffusion processes in the molten Li17Pb83 alloy sample and in the Fe sample holder above PH2 = 1000 Pa. From the data on tritium residence time obtained in PH2 = 3000 Pa, the diffusion coefficient of tritium was determined as follows: D/m2s−1 = 2.50 × 10−7exp(−27.0 kJmol−1/RT), which was slightly larger than the other literature values.},

	abstract = {In the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket for DEMO the breeding material is represented by eutectic lead lithium alloy flowing in poloidal–radial direction in the breeding module. The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2. The experimental device and the obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper.},

Solubility data were recorded in the pressure range 150—20000 hPa at temperatures up to 1220 K. Alloy interactions with stainless steel containers and with oxygen impurities were investigated. The temperature and pressure dependence of the mole fraction xH of hydrogen atoms in the melt at low hydrogen concentration, where Sievert's law is valid, can be described by the following equation: ln(xH√105Pa/PH2) = - A + B/T. The values of the constants are A = 8.17, B = 734 K (LiPb); A = 7.84, B = 1970 K (Li62Pb38); A = 7.42, B = 1200 K (LiIn); A = 7.67, B = 3300 K (Li62In38); A = 7.08, B = 600 K (Li57Sn43); A = 6.86, B = 830 K (Li62Sn38). Strong deviations from Sievert's law are observed for two alloys indicating alloy decomposition. The reduction of the excess entropy of dissolved hydrogen in the alloys compared to pure lithium is discussed in the frame of an electrostatic model.},

Each alloy was investigated at several temperatures from 50 to 400 K above the corresponding liquidus point and at hydrogen pressures up to 15 kPa. Sieverts' law (√P = KXH, as XH → O) was found to be obeyed under these conditions. The Sieverts' constants showed a 105-fold increase as the Pb content was increased over the stated composition range. The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead. Availability of the latter estimates permitted testing of three statistical mechanical models against the experimental data. The results were compared with other literature on the H-Li-Pb system.},

The diffusivities from 200K to 3000K are calculated and the diffusion equation is fitted to D=5.13×10−8exp(−0.21eV/kT)m2/s. The diffusion equations in different temperature ranges of 200–500K, 500–2400K and 2400–3000K are also given separately and the results imply different H diffusion modes in different temperature ranges, which is proved by analyzing equilibrium H positions at low and high temperatures. The H atom jumps between different tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) at lower temperatures, but the transition to octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) is also observed at high temperatures. Moreover, with a vacancy present in the W system, vacancy trapping of H is observed, and it is shown that the vacancy trapping reduces with the increasing temperature. The H binding energy to monovacancy is obtained using three different methods including NEB and fitting both H diffusivity and time for H to detrap from the vacancy, which provides more information of the H behaviors with the existence of defects.},

Here, we report results from periodic density-functional theory calculations for three crucial aspects of this interaction: surface-to-subsurface diffusion of H into W, trapping of H at vacancies, and H-enhanced decohesion, with a view to assess the likely extent of hydrogen isotope incorporation into tungsten reactor walls. We find energy barriers of (at least) 2.08 eV and 1.77 eV for H uptake (inward diffusion) into W(001) and W(110) surfaces, respectively, along with very small barriers for the reverse process (outward diffusion). Although H dissolution in defect-free bulk W is predicted to be endothermic, vacancies in bulk W are predicted to exothermically trap multiple H atoms. Furthermore, adsorbed hydrogen is predicted to greatly stabilize W surfaces such that decohesion (fracture) may result from high local H concentrations.},

	abstract = {The interaction of hydrogen with tungsten is investigated by means of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and statistical methods based on the transition-state theory and thermodynamics. This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},
