	abstract = {The diffusion coefficient of tritium in molten Li17Pb83 alloy was determined under neutron irradiation at 300–700°C. Tritium residence time in the experimental system decreased with increasing H2 pressure in He sweep gas up to 1000 Pa, and above this limiting concentration it became constant. This result suggests that the tritium release rate was controlled only by the tritium diffusion processes in the molten Li17Pb83 alloy sample and in the Fe sample holder above PH2 = 1000 Pa. From the data on tritium residence time obtained in PH2 = 3000 Pa, the diffusion coefficient of tritium was determined as follows: D/m2s−1 = 2.50 × 10−7exp(−27.0 kJmol−1/RT), which was slightly larger than the other literature values.},

	abstract = {In the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket for DEMO the breeding material is represented by eutectic lead lithium alloy flowing in poloidal–radial direction in the breeding module. The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2. The experimental device and the obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the hydrogen solubility in liquid alloys of the binary systems Li—In, Li—Pb and Li—Sn are reported. A detailled description of the experimental procedure is given. Solubility data were recorded in the pressure range 150—20000 hPa at temperatures up to 1220 K. Alloy interactions with stainless steel containers and with oxygen impurities were investigated. The temperature and pressure dependence of the mole fraction xH of hydrogen atoms in the melt at low hydrogen concentration, where Sievert's law is valid, can be described by the following equation: ln(xH√105Pa/PH2) = - A + B/T. The values of the constants are A = 8.17, B = 734 K (LiPb); A = 7.84, B = 1970 K (Li62Pb38); A = 7.42, B = 1200 K (LiIn); A = 7.67, B = 3300 K (Li62In38); A = 7.08, B = 600 K (Li57Sn43); A = 6.86, B = 830 K (Li62Sn38). Strong deviations from Sievert's law are observed for two alloys indicating alloy decomposition. The reduction of the excess entropy of dissolved hydrogen in the alloys compared to pure lithium is discussed in the frame of an electrostatic model.},

	abstract = {Isothermal measurements of hydrogen decomposition pressure (P) vs. hydrogen concentration (XH) were carried out on ten Li-Pb alloys in the composition range 0.1 ≤ XPb ≤ 0.8. Each alloy was investigated at several temperatures from 50 to 400 K above the corresponding liquidus point and at hydrogen pressures up to 15 kPa. Sieverts' law (√P = KXH, as XH → O) was found to be obeyed under these conditions. The Sieverts' constants showed a 105-fold increase as the Pb content was increased over the stated composition range. The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead. Availability of the latter estimates permitted testing of three statistical mechanical models against the experimental data. The results were compared with other literature on the H-Li-Pb system.},
