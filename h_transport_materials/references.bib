	abstract = {The diffusion of protium and deuterium in tungsten is measured in gas loading experiments as a function of temperature for a hydrogen isotope loading pressure of 500 mbar and temperatures between 1600 K and 2600 K. The diffusion parameters are measured from the degassing rates of both a single-crystalline and a polycrystalline tungsten cylinder by mass spectrometry. The data are analysed assuming an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence of the diffusivity and following the classical analysis approach of Frauenfelder (1969 J. Vac Sci. Technol. 6, 388). For deuterium in tungsten an activation energy of 0.06 eV is obtained. For protium the activation energy is identical within the uncertainty limits.},

The diffusivities from 200K to 3000K are calculated and the diffusion equation is fitted to D=5.13×10−8exp(−0.21eV/kT)m2/s. The diffusion equations in different temperature ranges of 200–500K, 500–2400K and 2400–3000K are also given separately and the results imply different H diffusion modes in different temperature ranges, which is proved by analyzing equilibrium H positions at low and high temperatures. The H atom jumps between different tetrahedral interstitial sites (TISs) at lower temperatures, but the transition to octahedral interstitial sites (OISs) is also observed at high temperatures. Moreover, with a vacancy present in the W system, vacancy trapping of H is observed, and it is shown that the vacancy trapping reduces with the increasing temperature. The H binding energy to monovacancy is obtained using three different methods including NEB and fitting both H diffusivity and time for H to detrap from the vacancy, which provides more information of the H behaviors with the existence of defects.},

In this study, after making the molten salts in an electric furnace and purifying the salts by HF, experiments were performed to determine the behavior of H2 permeation through the fluoride molten salts at static conditions in the range of 500-600 °C using an apparatus composed of tertiary cylindrical Monel400 tubes. In addition, transient H2 diffusion equations in molten salts were solved, and results were compared with experimental effluent H2 concentration curves. It is proved experimentally that the H2 permeability through Flibe or Flinak has linear pressure dependence, and permeability, diffusivity and solubility of H2 in the fluoride molten salts are correlated to their respective Arrhenius-type equations.},

              Interest in molten salts has increased significantly over the last decade due to their potential application in various clean-energy technologies including hydrogen generation, solar heat storage, advanced fission nuclear power plants, and compact fusion energy systems. In nuclear fission and fusion power plants, high heat capacity molten salts allow operation at high temperature and atmospheric pressure, which could dramatically increase efficiency, reduce capital cost, and enable passive safety features. In many of these systems, the hydrogen isotope is of particular importance due to its ability to corrode structural materials as

This model yields temperature-dependent data that can help understanding macro-scale experimental results. Within this model, the concentrations of trapped hydrogen atoms at thermodynamic equilibrium are established. Taking into account the configurational entropy, hydrogen is shown to induce vacancy formation below 1000K. Based on this model, TDS spectra are simulated with a basic kinetic model to provide some better insight into the desorption process of hydrogen. Finally, revised mechanisms for hydrogen diffusion in tungsten are proposed; we conclude that the discrepancy existing between the experimental diffusion coefficient measured by Frauenfelder (1969) and the one calculated by DFT would be reconciled provided one uses two different diffusion regimes that would depend on temperature and vacancies concentration.},

	abstract = {A study on the mobility of hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus in copper has been made.
In addition, the self-diffusion of copper has also been studied. Literature data has been reviewed,
and used to evaluate the temperature expressions of the diffusion coefficients of these elements in
copper. The interstitial elements oxygen and hydrogen have been described by a single temperature
expression in the whole temperature range, whereas the substitutional elements copper, sulphur,
and phosphorus have been modelled according to lattice diffusion at high temperatures and grain
boundary diffusion at low temperatures.
Sulphur, phosphorus, and copper are believed to be nearly immobile within the crystalline grains
at low temperature, even for time periods up to 100,000 years. On the other hand, in the grain
boundaries these elements can diffuse and an upper limit estimate of the possible diffusion distance
has been made. At room temperature sulphur can diffuse up to 5 cm for 100,000 years, whereas both
phosphorus and copper requires more than 1,000 000 years to diffuse the same distance. The oxygen
atom shows a similar mobility, although it is interstitially diffusing through the grains. However,
since both oxygen and sulphur have a very low solubility any measureable mass transport of these
elements will never take place at low temperatures. They will instead form oxides and sulphides in
the material.
Hydrogen is a mobile element, and will be able to diffuse through 5 cm of copper during a time period
of 1,000 years at room temperature. The diffusion of hydrogen in copper is experimentally well studied
down to room temperature. By combining the evaluated hydrogen diffusion coefficient with the
thermodynamically calculated hydrogen content in solid solution the permeability of hydrogen can be
explained. This can be used to explain the mass-transport of hydrogen for different times, temperatures,
and hydrogen activities (pressures).},

Experiments used a mass-analyzed, 3-keV D3+ ion beam with particle flux densities of 5×1019 to 7×1019 D/m2 s. Effective diffusivities and surface molecular recombination coefficients were derived giving Arrhenius pre-exponentials and activation energies for each material: CuCrZr alloy, (2.0×10−2 m2/s, 1.2 eV) for diffusivity and (2.9×x10−14 m4/s, 1.92 eV) for surface molecular recombination coefficients; OFHC Cu, (2.1×10−6 m2/s, 0.52 eV) for diffusivity and (9.1×10−18 m4/s, 0.99 eV) for surface molecular recombination coefficients. TMAP4 simulation of permeation data measured for a Cu/Be bi-layer sample was achieved using a four-layer structure (Cu/BeO interface/Be/BeO back surface) and recommended values for diffusivity and solubility in Be, BeO and Cu.},

	abstract = {Understanding the interaction between atomic hydrogen and solid tungsten is important for the development of fusion reactors in which proposed tungsten walls would be bombarded with high energy particles including hydrogen isotopes. Here, we report results from periodic density-functional theory calculations for three crucial aspects of this interaction: surface-to-subsurface diffusion of H into W, trapping of H at vacancies, and H-enhanced decohesion, with a view to assess the likely extent of hydrogen isotope incorporation into tungsten reactor walls. We find energy barriers of (at least) 2.08 eV and 1.77 eV for H uptake (inward diffusion) into W(001) and W(110) surfaces, respectively, along with very small barriers for the reverse process (outward diffusion). Although H dissolution in defect-free bulk W is predicted to be endothermic, vacancies in bulk W are predicted to exothermically trap multiple H atoms. Furthermore, adsorbed hydrogen is predicted to greatly stabilize W surfaces such that decohesion (fracture) may result from high local H concentrations.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen isotopes solubility in eutectic lithium–lead alloys is really important for the design of breeding blanket components that use this breeding material. The determination of the magnitude and kinetics of the tritium flux from the blanket to the helium cooling loop, along with the design of future tritium extraction systems of the breeding alloy or the He coolant purification system, will be defined on basic transport parameters such as solubility. The unacceptable scattering of Sieverts’ constant values in the historical measurements given by different experimental techniques, suggests that this is a very important and unresolved issue. In this work, it has been experimentally evaluated, using absorption and desorption techniques. The different measurement campaigns have been carried out in the temperature range from 523 to 922K and in the pressure range from 1 to 105Pa. This paper describes the work carried out in the preparation of the facility, the theoretical model developed to process the different results obtained by means of absorption and desorption runs. Final results obtained during several campaigns of measurements are provided. The obtained values of hydrogen solubility through the different campaigns show a similar value for the Sieverts’ constant, and therefore, a very little value for the activation energy in the solution process. Results are compared and discussed. The proposed correlation for hydrogen Sieverts’ constant in Pb–Li from these tests is KS [molm−3Pa−1/2]=8.64×10−3exp(–0.9/RT), R in (kJK−1mol−1).},

	abstract = {In order to provide data on diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of tritium in molten salts for the critical issue of tritium control in the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) program, a two-chamber permeability apparatus separated by a nickel plate had been developed for determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten salts. Descriptions on the permeability apparatus, experimental procedure and the analytical method for determining the diffusivity and solubility of hydrogen isotope in molten salts were presented in this paper. To assess the performance of the apparatus, the blank tests without molten salt were conducted at 300-700 degrees C. The results showed that the nickel plate acting as the window for hydrogen isotope permeation in the apparatus seemed to have less effect on experiments of determining the permeability of hydrogen isotope in molten slat at 500-700 degrees C. Furthermore, the applicability of the apparatus with molten salt was also evaluated experimentally, with test experiments of molten Flinak (LiF-NaF-KF) at 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C. Diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of hydrogen in molten Flinak can be derived from those test experiments, which were correlated to DFlinak-H = 7.06 x 10(-5) e(-54.9/(RgT)) m(2)/S and SFlinak-H = 1.67 x 10(-7) e(-27.0/(RgT)) mol-H-2/(m(3) Pa).},

The number of bubbles formed was typically loo{\textasciitilde} m - {\textasciitilde}C.onsideration of bubble growth leads to the conclusion that the increase in bubble volume during growth is due to plastic deformation of the lattice near the bubble and that the precipitation is a diffusion limited process, conclusions which are confirmed by the experimental evidence.

Then, the tritium release rate into the water was examined by a liquid scintillation counting technique and the surface tritium concentration by a tritium imaging plate technique. The tritium release from the metals is attributed to the release of dissolved tritium by diffusion from the normal interstitial sites, and the first order desorption of trapped one with detrapping energies of 64, 72 and 25kJmol−1 for Cu, Fe and Mo, respectively. Overall release behavior is varied depending on the ratio of dissolved and trapped amounts of tritium.},

A time sequence of the permeation rate shows a spike at intermediate temperatures as seen previously, while the maximum permeation rate tends to be saturated at high temperatures. These permeation behaviors have also been observed for Al the surface of which was covered by an oxide not removed by deuteron bombardment. The saturated permeation rate (Jp) is well expressed by Jp = rφ/d (r, φandd are the range of the incident ion, the incident flux, and th e specimen thickness, respectively), which is deduced from the assumption that both the reemission and the permeation are controlled by the diffusion process. According to recombination theory, the permeation rate should be much higher because the reemission is delayed by the surface oxide or other contaminants with small recombination coefficients. Therefore the recombination theory seems not to be applicable for the estimation of the ion driven permeation with high incident energies at above 500 K as made in the present work.},

	abstract = {In the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) blanket for DEMO the breeding material is represented by eutectic lead lithium alloy flowing in poloidal–radial direction in the breeding module. The low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in the alloy generates an high partial pressure and, as a consequence, an high tritium permeation rate from the breeder into the He coolant and a considerable tritium inventory in the structural materials. Several experiments, devoted to determine the hydrogen solubility in lead lithium, have been performed in the past, giving contradictory results. To find a reliable value to be used in the safety analysis and in the design of both the tritium extraction system and the coolant purification system, the solubility of hydrogen (SOLE) experiment was launched in ENEA Brasimone in 2002. The SOLE device is based on the use of the absorption technique. The experimental results are in good agreement with the ones obtained in the past with similar techniques, varying from 1×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2 up to 7×10−2molm−3Pa−1/2. The experimental device and the obtained results are presented and discussed in this paper.},

The temperature and pressure dependence of the mole fraction xH of hydrogen atoms in the melt at low hydrogen concentration, where Sievert's law is valid, can be described by the following equation: ln(xH√105Pa/PH2) = - A + B/T. The values of the constants are A = 8.17, B = 734 K (LiPb); A = 7.84, B = 1970 K (Li62Pb38); A = 7.42, B = 1200 K (LiIn); A = 7.67, B = 3300 K (Li62In38); A = 7.08, B = 600 K (Li57Sn43); A = 6.86, B = 830 K (Li62Sn38). Strong deviations from Sievert's law are observed for two alloys indicating alloy decomposition. The reduction of the excess entropy of dissolved hydrogen in the alloys compared to pure lithium is discussed in the frame of an electrostatic model.},

The InK vs. XPb, data, fitted to a thermodynamic model, yielded a semi-empirical equation which produced (1) Sieverts' constants within the measured temperature and composition ranges, (2) an inflection point at XPb, ∼0.3, presumably caused by the formation of partly ionic Li-Pb bonds, (3) a steady decrease in the temperature coefficient as a function of XPb, resulting in a sign reversal at XPb ∼0.6, and (4) Sieverts' constant estimates for pure liquid lead.

	abstract = {A torus-shaped sail consists of a reflective membrane attached to an inflatable torus-shaped rim. The sail’s deployment from its stowed configuration is initiated by introducing inflation pressure into the toroidal rim with an attached circular flat membrane coated by heat-sensitive materials that undergo thermal desorption (TD) from a solid to a gas phase. Our study of the deployment and acceleration of the sail is split into three steps: at a particular heliocentric distance a torus-shaped sail is deployed by a gas inflated into the toroidal rim and the membrane is kept flat by the pressure of the gas; under heating by solar radiation, the membrane coat undergoes TD and the sail is accelerated via TD of coating and solar radiation pressure (SRP); when TD ends, the sail utilizes thrust only from SRP. We study the stability of the torus-shaped sail and deflection and vibration of the flat membrane due to the acceleration by TD and SRP.
A tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen. Because it is radioactive, its release to the environment must be minimized. Accurately predicting tritium transports in fusion materials and fusion systems heavily depend on a reliable database of hydrogen mass transport properties (e.g., diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in fusion reactor materials. This article summarizes fundamental kinetics on hydrogen isotope in material and provides recommended mass transport properties (diffusivity, solubility, and permeability) in materials for nuclear application.
Beryllium will be one of the plasma-facing materials for ITER. It will have to sustain high fluxes of hydrogen isotopes and as a consequence significant amounts of tritium can be retained in the wall. For safety and operational reasons, the deuterium and tritium inventory in the vacuum vessel must be limited. As a consequence, hydrogen diffusion, trapping and solubility are of vital importance in assessing and modeling the plasma fuel retention into the wall. In order to understand these issues, point defects and the behavior of hydrogen in beryllium are investigated based on Density Functional Theory calculations. Although some data have already been acquired in the past, some of them disagree, which motivates further investigations. To do so, the formation energy and diffusion properties of point defects are investigated in the first part of this paper. In a second part, the solubility and diffusivity of hydrogen in beryllium are calculated. A diffusion coefficient is established in order to be used in Rate-Equation and Kinetic Monte-Carlo Kinetic models and to allow for comparison with experimental measurements.
An effective permeation reduction of gaseous hydrogen isotopes into a metal wall by introducing a barrier is essential in two main fields: prevention of hydrogen-embrittlement in steels and control of the tritium inventory in future nuclear fusion reactors. By far the most important advances and relevant studies originate from the Nuclear Fusion Community where tritium retention is an important issue, influencing safety issues.
Stable permeation barriers are searched among materials with the lowest bulk hydrogen solubility and diffusivity. Besides a few specific pure metals, like beryllium and tungsten, dense oxides, nitrides and carbides have been mostly investigated. Coating techniques for preparation of well adhered and perfect barriers are evidently of the same importance as the material selection itself. Most attractive are the techniques where an ad-layer is formed simply by oxidation. Other methods require specific gas environments with strong electric and magnetic fields, which may represent a limit for the ad-layers uniform coverage over large and uneven areas. Evaluation of the achieved barrier performances is another challenging task. Several new methods, which can trace hydrogen isotopes in bulk at very low concentrations, often miss in the determination of their mobility. Also, they do not reveal the role of barrier defects. The classical gas permeation rate method through coated membranes is still the most reliable option to determine the actual Hydrogen Permeation Barrier (HPB) efficiency. At elevated temperature, the hydrogen permeation rate is recorded at the downstream side of a coated membrane exposed to a substantially higher hydrogen upstream pressure. By using modern vacuum instrumentation techniques, even the most effective barriers can be well characterised.
Past experiments and modeling with the Tmap code in [1, 2] indicated that Be-D co-deposited layers are less (time-wise) efficiently desorbed of retained D in a fixed low-temperature bake, as the layer grows in thickness. In Iter, beryllium rich co-deposited layers will grow in thickness over the life of the machine. Although, compared with the analyses in [1, 2], Iter presents a slightly different bake efficiency problem because of instances of prior tritium recover/control baking. More relevant to Iter, is the thermal release from a new and saturated co-deposit layer in contact with a thickness of previously-baked, less-saturated, co-deposit.
Experiments that examine the desorption of saturated co-deposited over-layers in contact with previously baked under-layers are reported and comparison is made to layers of the same combined thickness. Deposition temperatures of ∼323 K and ∼373 K are explored. It is found that an instance of prior bake leads to a subtle effect on the under-layer. The effect causes the thermal desorption of the new saturated over-layer to deviate from the prediction of the validated Tmap model in [2]. Instead of the D thermal release reflecting the combined thickness and levels of D saturation in the over and under layer, experiment differs in that, i) the desorption is a fractional superposition of desorption from the saturated over-layer, with ii) that of the combined over and under -layer thickness. The result is not easily modeled by Tmap without the incorporation of a thin BeO inter-layer which is confirmed experimentally on baked Be-D co-deposits using X-ray micro-analysis.
Samples of three industrial beryllium trademarks, such as S-200F, S-65H and I-220H are irradiated at about 40 °C to the fluence of 1.5 × 1024 m−2 (E {\textgreater} 1.15 MeV) in reactor WWR-K. On completion of irradiation tests, post irradiation examinations (PIEs) against hardness are carried out, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. Also He/T2 release properties are measured by the thermal desorption (TDS) method.
Relevant obtained values of amounts of the released tritium and helium for all samples of irradiated beryllium are in good agreement, within inaccuracy, comprising 25 ± 3 wppm for helium-4 and 1.3 ± 0.3 wppm for tritium.},

Constant heating rate desorption was used to elucidate the effects of microstructural trap states on the apparent diffusivity of hydrogen in aluminum. Isothermal desorption of hydrogen from annealed, uniformly charged, cylindrical specimens was bulk diffusion controlled. Diffusion data exhibited simple Arrhenius behavior between 30 and 600°C and is described with 95\% confidence byD=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Constant heating rate desorption spectra revealed three distinct trapping states with desorption energies 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, and 84.8±32.2kJ/mol. These trapping states are associated with interstitial lattice sites, dislocations, and vacancies, respectively. Identification, quantification, and understanding the role of these trap states in permeation and desorption experiments helps explain the large scatter in reported values of the diffusivity of hydrogen in aluminum.

La diffusion et le piégeage de l'hydrogéne dans l'aluminium polycristallin haute pureté (99.999\% massique) ont été etudiés en utilisant à la fois des techniques de désorption isotherme et à vitesse de chauffage constante. La désorption à vitesse de chauffage constante est utilisée afin d'expliquer les effets des états de piégeage microstructural sur la diffusivité apparente de l'hydrogéne dans l'aluminium. La désorption isotherme de l'hydrogéne à partir d'échantillons cylindriques, chargés uniformément et recuits obéit à une loi d'Arrhénius simple dans un intervalle de température compris entre 30 et 600°C et est déscrite avec probabilité de 95\% par:D=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Le spectre de désorption à vitesse de chauffage constante a montré trois différents états de piégeage avec des énergies de 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, and 84.8±32.2kJ/mol. Les états de piégeage sont associés respectivement aux sites intersticiels du réseau, aux dislocations et aux lacunes. L'identification, la quantification et la compréhension du role de ces états de piégage lors des expériences de perméation et de désorption aident à expliquer la large dispersion des valeurs trouvées pour la diffusivité de l'hydrogéne dans l'aluminium.
Zusammenfassung
Diffusion und Einschluß von Wasserstoff in polykristallinem Reinstaluminium (99.999Gew.-\%) wurden mittels thermischer Desorption sowohl unter isothermen Bedingungen als auch bei konstanter Heizrate untersucht. Eine konstante Heizrate wurde eingesetzt, um die Einflüsse mikrostruktureller Einschlußzustände auf den Diffusionskoeffizienten von Wasserstoff in Aluminium zu ermitteln. Die isotherme Desorption von Wasserstoff von ausgeglühten, einheitlich geladenen, zylindrischen Proben ist durch Bulkdiffusion bestimmt. Die Diffusionsdaten zeigen einfaches Arrheniusverhalten zwischen 30 und 600°C und werden mit 95\%-iger Zuverlässigkeit beschrieben durch:D=1.75±0.15×10−8(m2/s)exp\{−16.2±1.5(kJ/mol)/RT\}.Die Desorptionsspektren bei konstanter Heizrate zeigten drei verschiedene Einschlußzustände mit Desorption energies von 15.3±4.8, 43.5±17.5, und 84.8±32.2kJ/mol. Diese Einschlußstadien waren mit Zwischengitterplätzen, Versetzungen, und Leerstellen assoziert. Identifizierung, Quantifizierung und das Verstehen der Rolle dieser Einschluß zustände in Permeabilitäts- und Desorptionsexperimenten hilft, die breite Streuung der berichteten Werte des Wasserstoffdiffusionskoeffizienten in Aluminium zu erklären.},
